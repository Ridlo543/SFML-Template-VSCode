# SFML-Template-ridloVers

This SFML-template is inspired by [@rizalanggoro](https://github.com/rizalanggoro) in [his repository](https://github.com/rizalanggoro/sfml-starter-v2) <br>
I modified that and created this SFML to make it easier to create SFML projects. <br>
all you need is just install mingw <br>
in this template using mingw64 7.3.0. you can customize it. [dowload mingw](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) <br>
and SFML is already available in the lib/ folder with the 64bit gcc version. you can customize it. [download SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) <br>
This project run in windows.
## How to run
- Make sure that you have mingw installed in [here](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
- find `mingw64-make.exe` or `mingw32-make.exe` in folder mingwxx/bin. and then rename to `make.exe`
- type `make` in terminal to executable all building project. <br>[`make clean` to clean build project] <br>[`make run` to run executable project]
